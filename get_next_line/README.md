# get_next_line

A foundational project from the **1337/42 school curriculum**.  
This repository contains a custom C function, **`get_next_line`**, designed to read a line from a file descriptor, regardless of the buffer size.

## Project Description
The **get_next_line** project challenges students to write a function that can read a single line from a file.  
The function must be able to handle a variety of situations, including:

- Reading from any valid file descriptor.  
- Handling files that do not end with a newline character.  
- Managing large files efficiently by handling reads of different sizes.  
- Correctly using static variables to remember the remaining data from previous calls.  

This project is crucial for developing a strong understanding of file I/O operations, memory allocation, and the management of static variables in C.

## Functions

The `get_next_line` function in this library:

- Reads a single line from a file, ending with a newline (`\n`) or the end of the file (EOF).  
- Returns the read line. The caller is responsible for freeing the memory.  
- Returns `NULL` on an error or at the end of the file.  
- Can handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously without losing its state.

## Installation

To compile and use the **get_next_line** library:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/achahid19/1337_projects.git

# Navigate into the get_next_line directory
cd 1337_projects/get_next_line

```

## Usage

To use `get_next_line` in your own C project, compile your source files and link them with the static library:

```bash
gcc your_program.c get_next_line.c -o your_program -I/path/to get_next_line/includes
```
You can call the `get_next_line` function in your code as follows:

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
	char *line;

	while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
		printf("%s", line);
		free(line); // Free the memory allocated for the line
	}

	close(fd);
	return 0;
}
```
