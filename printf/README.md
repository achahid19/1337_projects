# ft_printf

A project for the 1337/42 school curriculum, this repository contains a custom re-implementation of the standard C library's printf function. The goal is to build a function capable of handling a variable number of arguments and printing formatted output to the console.

## Project Description
The **ft_printf** project involves creating a function that replicates the behavior of the **printf** function from the standard C library. This includes correctly parsing a format string and printing corresponding arguments based on specified format specifiers. This project is a key step in understanding variadic functions and memory management in C.

---

## Functions

My ft_printf function supports the following format specifiers:

- **%c**: Prints a single character.

- **%s**: Prints a string.

- **%p**: Prints a pointer address in hexadecimal format.
- **%d**: Prints a signed decimal integer.

- **%i**: Prints a signed integer (same as %d).

- **%u**: Prints an unsigned decimal integer.

- **%x**: Prints a hexadecimal integer in lowercase.

- **%X**: Prints a hexadecimal integer in uppercase.

- **%%**: Prints a literal percent sign.
---

## Installation

To use the **ft_printf** library, clone the repository and compile the source files to create a static library:

```bash
git clone

cd 1337_projects/ft_printf

make
```

This will create **libftprintf.a**, a static library file.

## Usage

To use the **ft_printf** function in your C programs, include the header file and link against the static library:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
	ft_printf("Hello, %s! Your score is %d.\n", "World", 42);
	return 0;
}
```
Make sure to link against the library when compiling your program:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -L. -I. -lftprintf
```
options explained:
- `-L.`: Tells the compiler to look for libraries in the current directory.
- `-lftprintf`: Links against the **libftprintf.a** library.
- `-I.`: Tells the compiler to look for header files in the current directory.
