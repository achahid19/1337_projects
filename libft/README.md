# Libft

A custom C library created as part of the **1337/42 school curriculum**.  
The `libft` project is designed to build a foundational understanding of C programming by re-implementing a number of standard C library functions and creating new ones. This library serves as a cornerstone for future projects at the school.

## Project Description
This repository contains a personal C library, **Libft**, which includes a collection of functions that are essential for handling strings, memory, and character manipulation.  
The functions are reimplemented from the standard C library as well as a new set of utility functions created for the project.

## Functions

### **Part 1: Standard C Library Functions**
- `ft_memset` â€“ Fills memory with a constant byte.  
- `ft_bzero` â€“ Writes n zeroed bytes to the string `s`.  
- `ft_memcpy` â€“ Copies memory area.  
- `ft_memccpy` â€“ Copies memory until a character is found.  
- `ft_memmove` â€“ Copies memory area, safely handling overlapping memory.  
- `ft_memchr` â€“ Searches for the first occurrence of a character in a memory area.  
- `ft_memcmp` â€“ Compares memory areas.  
- `ft_strlen` â€“ Calculates the length of a string.  
- `ft_isalpha` â€“ Checks for an alphabetic character.  
- `ft_isdigit` â€“ Checks for a digit (0â€“9).  
- `ft_isalnum` â€“ Checks for an alphanumeric character.  
- `ft_isascii` â€“ Checks whether a character is an ASCII character.  
- `ft_isprint` â€“ Checks for a printable character.  
- `ft_toupper` â€“ Converts a lowercase letter to uppercase.  
- `ft_tolower` â€“ Converts an uppercase letter to lowercase.  
- `ft_strchr` â€“ Locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.  
- `ft_strrchr` â€“ Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.  
- `ft_strncmp` â€“ Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.  
- `ft_strlcpy` â€“ Copies a string to a buffer with a given size.  
- `ft_strlcat` â€“ Concatenates a string to a buffer with a given size.  
- `ft_strnstr` â€“ Locates a substring in a string, searching up to a given number of characters.  
- `ft_atoi` â€“ Converts a string to an integer.  
- `ft_calloc` â€“ Allocates memory and initializes it to zero.  
- `ft_strdup` â€“ Duplicates a string.  

### **Part 2: Additional Functions**
- `ft_substr` â€“ Extracts a substring from a string.  
- `ft_strjoin` â€“ Joins two strings into a new one.  
- `ft_strtrim` â€“ Removes characters from the beginning and end of a string.  
- `ft_split` â€“ Splits a string by a delimiter into an array of strings.  
- `ft_itoa` â€“ Converts an integer to a string.  
- `ft_strmapi` â€“ Applies a function to each character of a string to create a new string.  
- `ft_striteri` â€“ Applies a function to each character of a string.  
- `ft_putchar_fd` â€“ Writes a character to a file descriptor.  
- `ft_putstr_fd` â€“ Writes a string to a file descriptor.  
- `ft_putendl_fd` â€“ Writes a string to a file descriptor, followed by a newline.  
- `ft_putnbr_fd` â€“ Writes an integer to a file descriptor.  

### **Bonus Part: Linked List Functions**
- `ft_lstnew` â€“ Creates a new list element.  
- `ft_lstadd_front` â€“ Adds a new element at the beginning of a list.  
- `ft_lstsize` â€“ Counts the number of elements in a list.  
- `ft_lstlast` â€“ Returns the last element of a list.  
- `ft_lstadd_back` â€“ Adds a new element at the end of a list.  
- `ft_lstdelone` â€“ Deletes one element.  
- `ft_lstclear` â€“ Deletes and frees all elements from a list.  
- `ft_lstiter` â€“ Applies a function to each element's content.  
- `ft_lstmap` â€“ Applies a function to each element's content to create a new list.

## Installation

To compile and use the **libft** library:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/achahid19/1337_projects.git

# Navigate into the libft directory
cd 1337_projects/libft

# Compile the library
make
```

## Usage

To use libft in your own C project, compile your source files and link them with the static library:
```bash
gcc your_program.c -L. -lft -I. -o your_program
```
Flags explained:
- `-L.`: Tells the compiler to look for libraries in the current directory.
- `-lft`: Links against the `libft` library.
- `-I.`: Includes the current directory for header files.
